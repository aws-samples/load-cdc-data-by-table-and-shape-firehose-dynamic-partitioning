# Load CDC data by table and shape using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Dynamic Partitioning
This repository contains sample code for building test CDC data ingestion pipeline.

This project demonstrates how to use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Dynamic Partitioning feature for loading CDC data by table, shape & partition on the fly using three table examples. It also includes one table example for schema evolution over time. Follow the [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/load-cdc-data-by-table-and-shape-using-amazon-kinesis-data-firehose-dynamic-partitioning/) to get step by step guideline on creating test ingestion pipeline.
